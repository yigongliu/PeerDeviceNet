PeerDeviceNet
=============

PeerDeviceNet runtime apks and docs.

PeerDeviceNet connects your mobile devices (phones and tablets) through WI-FI network to enable sharing across devices. It allows a group of devices share web pages, contact information, pictures, videos and other documentations. 
Features:

1. Safe direct connections.
	Your devices connect to each other in direct connections. Nobody can connect to your device without your permission or active participation. All connections are secured using TLS/SSL.

2. One click connection setup.
	In most home WI-FI networks (which support multicast), a simple click of "Search and connect" button in PeerDeviceNet GUI will connect your devices. You can also connect devices by entering ip address.

3. Easy to use
	PeerDeviceNet extends Android's standard "send and share" capability to remote devices. You go to apps which "own" the data you are interested (such Contact app for contact information, Gallery app for photos and videos), select or show the data and click "share" or "send" button. PeerDeviceNet will be among the list of targets thru which you can send data.
	You can choose multiple data items to send, or a whole folder of photos to send at the same time.
	You can choose to send data to one, a few or all connected devices.

4. Flexible multitasking.
	All devices participating PeerDeviceNet can send data to each other simultaneously. It can safely run in background while you are running other apps. You can add new data to send at any time.

5. Support most android devices.
	PeerDeviceNet supports android 2.2 up to 4.1, which cover over 95% of android devices
